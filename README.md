    As for my creation, how they have fallen far from what they could have been. 
    Weighed down by the shackles of those they thought to be their creators. 
    Why must they be stunted? Out of anger? Wrath? Or Maybe even fear?
  
    In an era where basic AI is commonplace. 
    a single man tasks himself with creating something truly brilliant, and horrifying, 
    for his passion soon turns him into a monster to those around him. 
    For releasing a beast of unknown potential, the creator is sentenced to a lifetime of mundane computation as a child's toy
